## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Scrum breaks big projects into small chunks called "sprints" that last 2-4 weeks. This means that testing and feedback can happen more frequently, leading to faster iterative improvements

Every day, the team meets for just 15 minutes to share what they're working on and any problems they're facing. This helps solve issues quickly, and helps the team adapt to challenges fast.

With Scrum, your team works on the most important things first. For example, you might focus on getting the student database working before building a website for parents. This ensures the most critical systems are ready when needed.

After each sprint, the team talks about what went well and what didn't. This helps everyone keep getting better at their jobs. This is important for a growing school where needs change quickly.

Scrum also helps school leaders see what the IT team is doing. You'll have a clear list of planned projects, and regular updates show the progress being made.

By using Scrum, your school's IT team will respond better to changing needs, deliver new systems faster, work better with teachers and staff, and keep improving how they work.

Question 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
As a library member, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can find specific books I'm interested in borrowing.

As a library member, I want to reserve books that are currently checked out, so that I can borrow them when they become available.

As a student, I want to renew my borrowed books online, so that I don't have to visit the library in person to extend my borrowing period.

As a parent, I want to manage my children's library accounts from my profile, so that I can keep track of what books they've borrowed and when they're due.

As a library staff member, I want to see overdue books and send automatic reminders, so that I can ensure books are returned on time.

As a new user, I want to register for a library account online, so that I can start borrowing books without visiting the library in person.

As a frequent reader, I want to see my borrowing history, so that I can remember which books I've already read.

As a library administrator, I want to add new books to the catalog, so that members can see and borrow recent acquisitions.

As a busy professional, I want to receive notifications when books are due soon, so that I can return them on time and avoid late fees.

As a researcher, I want to browse books by academic subject categories, so that I can find relevant resources for my studies more efficiently.
